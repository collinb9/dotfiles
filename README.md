# Dotfiles
This repo contains all my dot files. Run
```
git clone git@github:collinb9/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```
to set everything up.

You should backup your existing dot files before you do this, as any with the same name as a file in this repo will be deleted.
